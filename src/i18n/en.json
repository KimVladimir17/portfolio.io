        "Tell me a little about yourself",
        "What technologies do you use in your projects?",
        "Which project has been the most interesting for you?",
        "How do you usually work in a team?",
        "What are your strengths as a developer?"
      ],
      "answers": [
        "I’m strong focus on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. I enjoy working with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and modern tools like <strong>Zustand</strong> and custom <strong>hooks</strong> to create <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>reusable components</strong>. And always pay attention to structure and clarity — I like when both users and developers can easily understand the product.",
        "Most of my projects are built with <strong>React + TypeScript</strong>, where I focus on clean component design and state management using <strong>Zustand</strong> and <strong>React Hooks</strong>. For <strong>API</strong> communication, I use <strong>Axios</strong> and structured service layers to keep the logic consistent. I also apply <strong>React-Hook-Form</strong> for flexible form control and <strong>validation</strong>. On the <strong>backend</strong> side, I’ve been exploring <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, learning how <strong>APIs</strong> and <strong>databases</strong> connect together.",
        "The most interesting project for me was <strong>Morago</strong> — a real-time translation and <strong>call platform</strong> for interpreters and clients. It combined everything I enjoy: user interface design, API integration, and <strong>WebRTC</strong> for <strong>live calls</strong>. I handled the <strong>frontend</strong> part — building <strong>dashboards</strong>, managing state with <strong>Zustand</strong>, and connecting to <strong>backend APIs</strong>. It was the project where learned how <strong>real-time</strong> data, authentication, and UI flow all come together in one system.",
        "In team projects, I focus on clear communication and organized <strong>Git</strong> workflow. Usually work through <strong>feature branches, frequent commits, and pull requests</strong> to keep the codebase clean. I also like using tools like <strong>Notion</strong> or <strong>Trello</strong> to track progress and make sure everyone is on the same page. I believe consistency and respect for others’ code is the key to good teamwork.",
        "I’d say my <strong>strengths</strong> are attention to <strong>detail</strong>, <strong>structured</strong> thinking, and <strong>adaptability</strong>. <br/> - Always try to make my code <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>reusable</strong>, and <strong>easy to maintain</.strong>. <br/> - Quickly adapt to <strong>new technologies</strong> and enjoy learning by doing — for me, <strong>every</strong> project is a chance to <strong>improve</strong>.<br/> - Also focus on <strong>UI/UX</strong> — making interfaces that feel natural for users."
